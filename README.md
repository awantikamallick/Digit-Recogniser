# Digit-Recogniser
## Here a simple two-layer neural network is created and trained it on the MNIST digit recognizer dataset.
  Our Neural Network will have a simple two-layer architecture. Input layer  a[0]  will have 784 units corresponding to the 784 pixels in each 28x28 input image. 
  A hidden layer  a[1] will have 10 units with ReLU activation, and finally our output layer a[2] will have 10 units corresponding to the ten digit classes with softmax activation.

## MNIST Dataset
The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.
